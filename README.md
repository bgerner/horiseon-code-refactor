Horiseon Code Refactor (Challenge 1)
    Notes:
- added alt attributes to all images - (semi) important ones containing a description, 3 logo images on the side left empty
- hanged divs to headers, mains, asides, and footer for the natural main/ aside sections
- added id of “search-engine-optimization” to div directly under <main class=”content”> so corresponding button in header would do its job
- removed preceding “benefit-” from lead, brand, and cost tags in the <aside class=”benefits”> section to avoid potential confusion from repetition of the word “benefit(s)”
- gave each sentence of main p text its own line in HTML
- changed div class=”hero” to section class=”hero” 
- changed divs within header containing links to other parts of the page to navs + corresponding css changes
- changed divs in main and aside sections to articles - NO MORE DIVS!
- changed footer from h2 to h3
- added alt descriptions for last 3 imgs
